**REST vs SOAP – Just Fundamentals**

When diving into the world of web services, developers often encounter two widely-used ways to enable communication between systems: **SOAP** and **REST**.  
While both serve the same ultimate goal — to enable communication between a client and a server — they do so in fundamentally different ways.

Let’s break them down to their essence. No fluff, no fanboy wars — just clean, core understanding.

---

### SOAP: The Protocol

**Transport**  
SOAP messages are typically sent over **HTTP POST**, but can also be transported using **SMTP** and other protocols.  
Regardless of the transport, **SOAP is its own protocol** — independent and structured.

**Why It Is a Protocol**  
SOAP (**Simple Object Access Protocol**) is called a protocol because it has a well-defined message structure.  
Every SOAP message wraps its content in a strict **XML-based format** called the **SOAP Envelope**.

The Envelope contains:

- **Header** *(optional)*: for metadata like authentication, transaction control, etc.  
- **Body** *(mandatory)*: contains the actual request or response — the operation and data being exchanged.

**Note:**  
This body is *not* to be confused with the HTTP body; SOAP is transported in the HTTP body,  
but its internal structure is defined by the **SOAP specification**.

**WSDL Agreement**  
SOAP uses a **WSDL (Web Services Description Language)** file — a contract that the client and server agree upon.

This WSDL defines:

- The available operations  
- The expected XML structure of each request and response  
- The data types for input and output  

Everything is **predefined, agreed upon, and non-negotiable**.

**Strict Validation**  
SOAP is **strict**.  
If the incoming request does not comply with the expected structure (defined by the WSDL and SOAP spec),  
the service fails — typically returning a **structured fault message**.

**Example**  
Here's a sample SOAP request for a **currency conversion**:

```xml
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
                  xmlns:web="http://www.webserviceX.NET/">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <web:ConversionRate>
         <web:FromCurrency>USD</web:FromCurrency>
         <web:ToCurrency>EUR</web:ToCurrency>
      </web:ConversionRate>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
```
The server knows exactly how this should look because it’s defined in the WSDL.

### REST: The Architectural Style**

**Transport**  
RESTful services use the **HTTP protocol** directly, leveraging methods like:

- `GET` – retrieve resources  
- `POST` – create resources  
- `PUT` – update resources  
- `DELETE` – remove resources  

---

**Why It Is Not a Protocol**  
REST is **not a protocol**. It’s an **architectural style** — a set of principles or constraints, not a rigid specification like SOAP.

REST emphasizes:

- **Statelessness** – each request contains all necessary information; no session state is stored on the server  
- **Resource-based URLs** – operations are performed via HTTP verbs on meaningful URLs  
- **Uniform interface** – consistent and predictable operations (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)

There is **no predefined message format or structure**.  
REST APIs commonly use **JSON**, but can also use **XML**, **HTML**, or **plain text**.  
The structure and content are determined by the developer.

---

**No Pre-Agreement Contracts (By Default)**  
REST does **not require a contract** like WSDL.  
There is no strict validation of request or response formats.

If a client sends incorrect or incomplete data, the server might respond with:

- `400 Bad Request`  
- `404 Not Found`  
- `422 Unprocessable Entity`

However, the **parsing logic** and **expected structure** are not enforced by a specification — it's based on mutual understanding between the client and server.

---

**Note:**  
In REST, API usage and documentation are often described using **Swagger/OpenAPI** or internal API docs.

These help clients understand:

- How to send data the server expects  
- How to interpret the response  

But this is **not validated at runtime** — it's **guidance**, not a rulebook.

---

**Example**

A RESTful API call to get a currency conversion:

```http
GET /api/convert?from=USD&to=EUR
Host: api.example.com
```
The response might be:
```json
{
  "from": "USD",
  "to": "EUR",
  "rate": 0.85
}
```
> **Note:**  
> REST can use **JSON**, **XML**, or any other text-based format.  
> It is not tied to any specific data format — it's simply a **conceptual architecture** that defines principles for designing networked applications.

The client and server must agree on the format, but there’s no contract enforcing this.


### **Summary for REST vs SOAP**


**SOAP**

- **Transport:**  
  Sent over **HTTP POST** or **SMTP**

- **Why It Is a Protocol:**  
  SOAP has a **well-defined structure** — a **SOAP Envelope**, which includes:  
    - An optional **Header** (for metadata, authentication, etc.)  
    - A mandatory **Body** containing the operation and data  

  **Note:** This is **not the same** as the HTTP body — SOAP is *transported* in the HTTP body, but its internal structure is defined by the SOAP specification.

- **WSDL Agreement:**  
  The client and server share a **WSDL (Web Services Description Language)** that defines:  
    - What operations exist  
    - What XML format each operation must follow  
    - What types are expected  

- **Strict Validation:**  
  If the request does **not comply** with the expected SOAP structure, it **fails** — typically returning a structured fault message.


**REST**

- **Transport:**  
  Sent over HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)

- **Why It Is Not a Protocol:**  
  REST is an **architectural style**, not a rigid protocol like SOAP.  
  It defines principles such as **statelessness** and **resource-based URLs**, but does **not** enforce a strict message format.

- **Message Format:**  
  Typically uses **JSON** or **XML**, but the structure is decided by the developer and **not enforced** by any specification.

- **No Pre-Agreement Contracts (By Default):**  
  REST does **not** require a shared schema or agreement like WSDL.  
  The client and server must mutually understand the input and output formats.If the server cannot understand the data (due to wrong format or missing fields), it returns a **4xx error**,but no strict parsing rules are enforced.

> **Note:**  
> In REST, API usage and documentation are typically specified using **Swagger**, **OpenAPI**, or other API docs.  
> These help clients understand how to send information the server expects and how to interpret responses.  
>  
> However, this is **not** a form of validation or strict formatting enforcement — it is simply a mutual understanding between the developer and the client.
