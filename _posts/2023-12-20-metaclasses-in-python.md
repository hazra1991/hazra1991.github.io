**A clear, practical guide for Python 3 (and a note about old-style Python 2 syntax)**

> Metaclasses are advanced—but elegant—tools that let you influence *how classes are created*. If you think of classes as blueprints for objects, then metaclasses are the blueprints for *classes*. Use them when you really need to control class creation and behavior.

---

- In Python everything is an *object* — even classes.
- Classes are instances of a *metaclass*. By default that metaclass is `type`.
- `type(name, bases, dict)` is the dynamic form of the `class` statement.
- To change how classes are built, subclass `type` and override the metaclass hooks (`__prepare__`, `__new__`, `__init__`, `__call__`).
- Prefer simpler tools (decorators, `__init_subclass__`) for most cases — metaclasses are powerful and can be overkill.

## 1. Everything is an object

In Python *everything* is an object: strings, numbers, lists — and yes, classes. That means you can call `type()` on an instance to get the class it belongs to:

```py
>>> type('hello')
<class 'str'>
>>> isinstance('hello', str)
True
```

Because classes are objects, the classes themselves have a *type* — their metaclass:

```py
>>> type(int)
<class 'type'>
>>> isinstance(int, type)
True
```

`type` is the default metaclass that creates (and defines the behavior of) normal classes.

---

## 2. What is a metaclass?

A **metaclass** is simply the class of a class — it controls *how* classes are created. By default Python uses `type` as the metaclass, but you can provide your own metaclass to intercept and modify class construction.

A class definition like below is *roughly equivalent* to calling `type()`:

```py
class MyClass(Base):
    attr = 1
```

is internally similar to:

```py
MyClass = type('MyClass', (Base,), {'attr': 1})
```

So, creating classes with `class` syntax calls `type` (or your custom metaclass) under the hood.

---

## 3. `type()` — the class factory

`type()` behaves differently depending on how many arguments you pass:

- `type(obj)` → returns the type (class) of `obj`.
- `type(name, bases, dict)` → dynamically creates a new class. The arguments are:
  - `name` (string) → becomes `__name__` of the new class.
  - `bases` (tuple) → base classes, becomes `__bases__`.
  - `dict` (mapping) → the namespace for class attributes and methods, becomes `__dict__`.

This is how the `class` statement is implemented internally.

Example:

```py
MyDynamic = type('MyDynamic', (object,), {'x': 42, 'hello': lambda self: 'hi'})
print(MyDynamic, MyDynamic.x)
```

---

## 4. Metaclass hooks and where to use them

To customize class creation, subclass `type` and override the hooks that `type` exposes. The most important hooks are `__prepare__`, `__new__`, `__init__`, and (optionally) `__call__`.

### `__prepare__`

`__prepare__` is called *before* the class body is executed. It returns the mapping (namespace) used during the class body execution (by default this is a plain `dict`). You can return any mapping — for example an `OrderedDict` to preserve definition order or a custom mapping that records attribute creation.

Signature (conceptual):

```py
@classmethod
def __prepare__(metacls, name, bases, **kwargs):
    return mapping
```

This hook was introduced in PEP 3115 and makes it possible to control the class namespace.

### `__new__` vs `__init__` (metaclass and instance level)

There are two analogous creation stages both for instances and for classes.

**Instance level:**

- `__new__` (a static method-like constructor) is responsible for creating and returning a new instance.
- `__init__` initializes the already-created instance.

**Metaclass level (when creating classes):**

When a class statement runs, the metaclass' `__new__` and `__init__` are invoked to construct the *class object* itself. If you subclass `type`, the signatures look like:

```py
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(mcls, name, bases, namespace):
        # called first — must return the class object
        return super().__new__(mcls, name, bases, namespace)

    def __init__(cls, name, bases, namespace):
        # called after __new__ — initialize the class object
        super().__init__(name, bases, namespace)
```

Important: if `__new__` in the metaclass does not return a class object (usually `super().__new__`), the `__init__` of the metaclass may never be called.

### `__call__`

When you call `SomeClass()` to create an instance, the call flow is:

1. The metaclass' `__call__` is invoked (by default that's `type.__call__`).
2. That implementation calls the class' `__new__` to create the instance.
3. Then it calls the class' `__init__` to initialize the instance.

If you override `__call__` in a metaclass, you can intercept or modify instance creation for *all classes* created with that metaclass.

Flow summary for class instantiation:

```
Metaclass.__call__()  ->  Class.__new__()  ->  Class.__init__()
```

Flow summary for class creation (the metaclass creating the class):

```
Metaclass.__prepare__() -> execute class body -> Metaclass.__new__() -> Metaclass.__init__()
```

## 5. Example metaclasses (practical snippets)

### 5.1 A simple logging metaclass

This metaclass logs when classes are created:

```py
class LoggingMeta(type):
    def __new__(mcls, name, bases, namespace):
        print(f"Creating class {name}")
        return super().__new__(mcls, name, bases, namespace)

class My(metaclass=LoggingMeta):
    pass

# Output: Creating class My
```

### 5.2 Registering subclasses automatically

A common practical use: automatically register subclasses (useful for plugin systems):

```py
class RegistryMeta(type):
    def __init__(cls, name, bases, namespace):
        if not hasattr(cls, 'registry'):
            # base class — create the container
            cls.registry = []
        else:
            # concrete subclass — register it
            cls.registry.append(cls)
        super().__init__(name, bases, namespace)

class Base(metaclass=RegistryMeta):
    pass

class A(Base):
    pass

class B(Base):
    pass

print(Base.registry)  # [<class '__main__.A'>, <class '__main__.B'>]
```

### 5.3 Enforcing naming or attribute rules

You can enforce coding rules at class creation time (raise an error if a rule is violated):

```py
class NoPublicAttrsMeta(type):
    def __init__(cls, name, bases, namespace):
        for attr in namespace:
            if not attr.startswith('_') and callable(namespace[attr]):
                raise TypeError("Public methods are not allowed")
        super().__init__(name, bases, namespace)
```

(Use such strict rules sparingly — they can make code harder to extend.)

---

## 6. When to use (and when not to)

Metaclasses are powerful but often unnecessary. Consider alternatives first:

- **Class decorators** — good to modify or wrap a single class.
- **`__init_subclass__`** — a hook that runs on subclass creation; good for per-class initialization logic without the complexity of a metaclass.
- **Registries and factories** built from regular classes and modules.

If you need to enforce policy or behavior across many classes or want subclasses to *inherit* the customization automatically, a metaclass is appropriate.

A famous community guideline: “Metaclasses are deeper magic than 99% of users should ever worry about.” That’s a reminder to prefer simpler tools when they suffice.

---

## 7. Gotchas & tips

- **Multiple inheritance & metaclass conflicts:** If two base classes have different metaclasses, Python computes the appropriate metaclass (it must be compatible) and may raise `TypeError` if there’s a conflict. The rule is similar to MRO — the resulting metaclass must be a (non-strict) subclass of all involved metaclasses.
- **Always return the result of `super().__new__`** from a metaclass `__new__` unless you have a very specific reason not to — otherwise class initialization flow can break.
- **`__prepare__` controls the namespace** used during class body execution — useful for preserving order or using custom dict-like behavior.
- **`__call__` intercepts instance creation** for all classes using that metaclass. Overriding it without calling `super()` can break expected behaviors.
- **Keep metaclass logic simple and well-tested** — it affects *every* class built with it.

## Appendix: Quick reference snippets

### Example: dynamic class creation

```py
# same as "class X: ..."
X = type('X', (object,), {'value': 10, 'greet': lambda self: 'hello'})
```

### Minimal metaclass template

```py
class Meta(type):
    def __prepare__(mcls, name, bases, **kwargs):
        return super().__prepare__(name, bases)

    def __new__(mcls, name, bases, namespace):
        # modify namespace if needed
        return super().__new__(mcls, name, bases, namespace)

    def __init__(cls, name, bases, namespace):
        super().__init__(name, bases, namespace)

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        # control instance creation
        return super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
```

---

### Python 2 note (historical)

In Python 2 there was an `__metaclass__` hook inside the class body or as a module-level variable. In Python 3 the preferred syntax is the `metaclass=` keyword in the class header (and Python 3 uses new-style classes by default).

---

### Closing thoughts

Metaclasses let you program at the level of class creation. They're a powerful tool that, used carefully, can simplify patterns that are otherwise awkward or repetitive. When in doubt: try a decorator or `__init_subclass__` first — if those don’t fit, a well-designed metaclass can be the elegant answer.
