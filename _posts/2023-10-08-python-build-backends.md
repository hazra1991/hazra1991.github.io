###  What Is a Build Backend?

A **build backend** is the tool that actually **builds your Python package** ‚Äî turning your source code into a wheel (`.whl`) or source distribution (`.tar.gz`).

####  Examples of Build Backends

| Backend     | Description                                     |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **setuptools** | Most common, flexible traditional backend        |
| **flit**        | Simpler, minimal-config packaging backend       |
| **poetry**      | Full project management (build + dependencies)  |
| **hatchling**   | Modern backend focused on speed/flexibility     |

---

### What Is a Build Frontend?

A **build frontend** is the tool that **calls the backend** to perform the actual **build or install** process.

#### Popular Build Frontends

| Frontend     | Description                                |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **pip**      | The default Python package installer       |
| **build**    | CLI tool to build wheels/sdists            |
| **installer**| Used internally by `pip` to install wheels |


## How Frontend and Backend Communicate

This communication is defined by **[PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/)**.

---

###  Interface Exposed by the Backend (in Python)

All build backends **must** expose the following standard hooks:

```python
# Required build backend hooks
def build_wheel(wheel_directory, config_settings=None, metadata_directory=None):
    pass

def build_sdist(sdist_directory, config_settings=None):
    pass
# optional build backend hooks
def get_requires_for_build_wheel(config_settings=None):
    pass

def prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel(metadata_directory, config_settings=None):
    pass
```
For Editable Installs (Optional, PEP 660)
Backends may implement this hook to support [editable installs]:

```python

def build_editable(wheel_directory, config_settings=None, metadata_directory=None):
    pass
```

### Where Do You Define the Backend?

You define the build backend in your `pyproject.toml` file under the `[build-system]` section:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=64", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```
**Build-system Keys Explained**

`requires`  
Build dependencies that `pip` installs into an isolated build environment **before** building your project.

`build-backend`  
The Python import path of the build backend to use for building your package.

---

#### What `pip` Does with This Information

- Creates a **temporary isolated build environment**.

- Installs the specified **build dependencies** (e.g., `setuptools` and `wheel`).

- Imports the backend module (e.g., `setuptools.build_meta`).

- Calls backend hooks like `build_wheel()` or `build_sdist()` to build your project.

### Build Frontend Tool ‚Äì **`python -m build`**

To explicitly test building your project, you can run:

```bash
python -m build
```

This command uses the build backend specified in your pyproject.toml and generates the following distribution files:

- **dist/projectname-version.whl ‚Äî üì¶ Wheel (binary distribution)**

- **dist/projectname-version.tar.gz ‚Äî üì¶ Source distribution (sdist)**


### [Editable Installs (PEP 660)]({{ site.posts | where: "slug", "pip-and-editable-install" | first.url | relative_url }})

Modern editable installs now use build backends.

```bash
pip install -e .
```
If your backend supports editable installs (e.g., setuptools>=64), it must expose the following hook `build_editable(...)`.

This allows `pip` to install a lightweight pointer (`__editable__project.pth`) instead of copying all files into the environment.

- üìù Previously, editable installs involved **physically copying project files** or creating **complex symlinks**, which was not compliant with modern packaging standards (as defined in [PEP 660](https://peps.python.org/pep-0660/)).

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Some IDEs and linters may still **not fully support** the new editable install mechanism. Compatibility is expected to improve as tooling catches up with the updated standards.


## How to Choose a Backend?

| You want to...                    | Recommended Backend  |
|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| Full control, traditional approach | `setuptools`         |
| Simplicity, minimal config         | `flit`               |
| All-in-one package management      | `poetry`             |
| Fast and modern builds             | `hatchling`          |

---

### Final Thoughts

- The build system separates concerns:  
  Frontend tools install/build, backend tools define how it‚Äôs done.

- `pyproject.toml` is the entrypoint for all modern builds.

- Backends must implement standard **PEP 517** hooks so `pip` (and others) can work with them.

- Stick with **PEP 517/518/621** for future-proof packaging.

- Avoid `setup.py` if you‚Äôre starting fresh ‚Äî use `pyproject.toml` instead.
